# SchoolSystem

This is a project I decided to make for my grades 11 & 12 Computer Science classes. Since our culminatings were open, I though i would try using GUI's and a database. Since it was a school project, I thought it would be fun to make a school management system. This project taught me a lot about objects and how to store them in a no-sql databse. I also learned how to use java's default gui library Swing with moderate proficiency.
